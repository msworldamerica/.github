Miss World, the oldest and largest international pageant, is celebrated in 143 countries and renowned for its commitment to service, having raised over $1.3 billion for charity. Global icons like Priyanka Chopra Jones and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan are among its past winners.

Contestants will dazzle in their state costumes during an opening dance, pitch their service projects, and answer Q&A in the hopes of winning the coveted title.

The Ms World America Pageant is scored using the same format and scoring configuration as its international counterpart, Ms World International. 4 phases of competition (interview / photoshoot / fitness / evening gown) - Each delegates lowest scoring phase of competition is dropped. Base pageant score is made up of each delegates top 3 scoring phases of competition. Optional competitions never make up a delegates base pageant score.
